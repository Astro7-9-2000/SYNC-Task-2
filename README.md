This is a real time face mask detection system that is built upon python to detect whether a person wore the mask or not. The system uses a webcam that highlights the face of the person in a green box and taga MASKED to it if the user has used mask.If not then it doesn,t respond with anything.
To design this system these are the folllowing requirements:-

<ul>
  <li> Visual Studio Code (latest upgraded version) </li>
  <li>Python 3.8</li>
  <li>Python libraries - numpy , opencv</li>
  <li>Datasbase - haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml</li>
  <li>System specification used :- Windows 11</li>
                               <li>8GB RAM</li>
                               <li>Intel Core i5</li>
                              <li>Intel iRISXe Graphics</li>
  </ul>
